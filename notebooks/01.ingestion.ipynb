In result, we find no merit in the Appeal. We find no reasons to interfere with the impugned order. The Appeal is dismissed,\" said NCLAT.</p><p>NCLAT order came over a petition filed by Air Wave Technocrafts, which provided services for the operation and maintenance of HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning) systems to Voltas\\' clients, seeking to initiate the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) under Section 9 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). A running account was maintained with Voltas for this purpose.</p><p>Elucidating on the payment mechanism, the Operational Creditor raised invoices for the payment for services rendered, supported by necessary documents like ESI/PF challans and Wages Register etc. to Voltas, which, after necessary verification, would forward these invoices/documents to their clients.</p><p>The operational creditor claimed a total debt of Rs 1.20 crore and had issued a demand notice in February 2024. </p><p>Voltas disputed the outstanding liability, prompting Air Wave Technocrafts to file the insolvency application in August 2024.</p><p><strong>Related News | </strong><div><a href=\"https://www.etnownews.com/companies/tata-technologies-acquires-100-shareholding-in-es-tec-gmbh-cost-benefits-and-other-details-article-153214689\"><img src=\"https://images.etnownews.com/thumb/msid-153214689,imgsize-491555,width-1280,height-720,resizemode-75/153214689.jpg\" /><p>Tata Technologies acquires 100% shareholding in ES-Tec GmbH - Cost, benefits and other DETAILS</p></a></div></p><p>The NCLAT affirmed the NCLT\\'s finding, stating that the email chain between Air Wave Technocrafts and Voltas clearly \"reflects ongoing disputes\" regarding work certification, amounts, and supporting documentation.</p><p>\"We see no reason to take a different view in the matter from that of the Adjudicating Authority (NCLT) in rejecting the Section 9 application on valid grounds of pre-existing disputes. In result, we find no merit in the Appeal. We find no reasons to interfere with the impugned order. The Appeal is dismissed,\" said NCLAT.</p><p>The core of the dispute centered on Voltas\\'s failure to complete payments to its operational creditor, Air Wave Technocrafts, following the client payment process.</p><p>Once the clients released payments to Voltas, after making TDS deduction, the Tata group firm would in turn, release payments to the appellant after holding back some amount as retention money.</p><p>In the petition, it was submitted that Voltas later failed to discharge its payment obligations. Subsequent correspondence with Voltas regarding the outstanding invoices only yielded a response that the outstanding dues have been put up for commercial verification.</p><p>The operational creditor claimed a total debt of Rs 1.20 crore and sent a demand notice on February 17, 2024. However, Voltas did not make further payments and instead disputed the outstanding liability, including raising the issue of limitation.</p><p>Following that, Air Wave Technocrafts filed a Section 9 application for initiation of Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process against Voltas before NCLT on August 29, 2024, which was dismissed on May 27, 2025. This was subsequently challenged before the NCLAT.</p><p>(With agency inputs)</p>'}],\n",
